1. Monolithic architecture

 Monolithic architecture is a software design where all components of an application are combined into a single, unified application. It is a traditional approach to software development and is characterized by a single, monolithic codebase that contains all the components of the application, including user interface (UI), business logic, and data access. Monolithic architectures are typically deployed as a single unit and can be difficult to scale or maintain as the application grows over time.


2. Microservices

 Microservices is an architectural style for building applications as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services. Each microservice runs a separate process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism such as a RESTful API. Microservices are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. They can be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies. Microservices are small enough that they can be developed, tested and deployed independently. This enables organizations to deliver software faster, with more flexibility and scalability than traditional monolithic applications.


3. Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?

 I am most interested in microservice architecture as it provides a great deal of flexibility and scalability. It allows for the development of applications that are composed of small, independent services that can be deployed and managed separately. This allows for more rapid development cycles and easier maintenance, since each service can be updated or replaced without affecting the other services. Additionally, microservices can be deployed to different cloud providers or on-premise servers, making it easy to scale up or down depending on the needs of the application.
 
4. Is Nodejs a multithreaded language?

 No, Node.js is not a multithreaded language. It is a single-threaded, event-driven language that uses non-blocking I/O operations to handle multiple concurrent requests.

5.  What does REPL stand for?

 REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.
